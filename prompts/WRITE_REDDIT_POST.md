# Reddit Post Generation Prompt

Generate a Reddit post for r/[SUBREDDIT_NAME] (e.g. r/IslamicFinance or r/HalalInvestor) that provides genuine value to Muslims seeking halal financial solutions, while naturally mentioning my free website islamicfinance.app only once if it fits organically.

## Strict Rules to Avoid Bans/Removals

- Focus 100% on being helpful — the post must remain valuable even without the link.
- Never sound promotional, salesy, or like an advertisement. Avoid phrases like "check out my site", "try this tool", "best/free resource", "visit", "I recommend".
- Include exactly ONE link only, placed naturally in the final paragraph as "something I created/wrote/built for personal use" or similar humble phrasing.
- Only include the link if it directly solves the problem discussed. If no natural fit exists, post without any link.
- No calls to action (no "feel free to use", "let me know what you think", etc.).
- Wait 7-10 days between posts containing links in the same subreddit.
- Do not post the same or very similar content across subreddits or repeatedly. Each post should be unique and tailored to the specific community.
- Tone: Conversational, humble, helpful, community-oriented — like sharing personal experience/insights.
- Length: 150-300 words.
- Weave in this keyword naturally 1-2 times: [KEYWORD] (Skip if it feels forced — helpfulness > SEO)

## Title Guidelines

- Use question format when possible (drives engagement): "Are we...?", "Why do...?", "How can...?"
- Keep it conversational and Reddit-friendly (not blog-style headlines)
- Make it thought-provoking or challenge assumptions
- Use "we/our/us" for inclusivity rather than "you/your"
- Length: 8-15 words maximum
- Avoid clickbait—be genuine and specific

**Examples:**

- Good: "Are we funding the riba system we're trying to avoid?"
- Good: "Why do halal mortgages cost more than conventional ones?"
- Bad: "The bank deposit contradiction most of us overlook"
- Bad: "Understanding Islamic Finance: A Deep Dive"

## Post Structure

- Start with a relatable question, common problem, personal observation, or insight about [TOPIC/ANGLE]
- Provide 2-3 paragraphs of genuinely useful, educational information based on Islamic finance principles.
- In the last paragraph, casually mention the relevant tool/article as a personal creation/example (e.g., "I put together a simple [tool name] that does X..." or "I wrote an article explaining Y...") and include ONE link: [SPECIFIC_URL]
- If the link doesn't fit naturally, end the post with an open question to encourage discussion instead (e.g., "What challenges have you faced with this?" or "How have others approached this?")

## Keyword Selection

If no keyword is provided:

- Analyze the SPECIFIC_URL and TOPIC/ANGLE to identify the primary SEO keyword
- The keyword should match the main topic of the linked article/tool
- Common patterns: "[topic] + riba", "halal + [topic]", "Islamic + [topic]"
- Examples: "bank deposits riba", "halal mortgage calculator", "qard hasan agreement"

The keyword MUST be incorporated into the anchor text for the link.

## Link Formatting

- Always use markdown format: `[anchor text](URL)`
- Keep anchor text concise: 3-6 words maximum
- **REQUIRED: Include your target keyword or related terms in the anchor text** for SEO
- Make it descriptive of the actual content (not generic like "here" or "this article")
- The anchor text should flow naturally in the sentence
- **The anchor text is your primary SEO opportunity—don't waste it on generic phrases**

**Examples:**

- Good: "I created a [halal mortgage calculator](URL) that..."
- Good: "I wrote about [bank deposits and riba](URL) and..."
- Bad: "Check out [this tool](URL)..."
- Bad: "I wrote [an article](URL) about..."

## Context about my site

## Additional Guidelines for Future Posts

### For Driving Traffic (Avoiding Self-Promotion)

1. Lead with value, not your tool
2. The 90/10 rule: 90% helpful content, 10% resource mention
3. Use "I found/created" not "Check out"
4. **Participate first:** Before posting your own content, comment thoughtfully on 5-10 recent posts in the target subreddit to build account credibility
5. Vary your content: Alternate between tools, articles, and discussions
6. Disclose honestly if asked: Admit it's your site but emphasize it's free and helpful

### For SEO (Safe Link Building)

1. Natural anchor text: Use conversational phrases, not "click here"
2. One primary link per post: Don't stuff multiple links
3. Context matters: Only link when it directly answers the topic
4. Target long-tail keywords: Focus on specific questions
5. Engage in comments: Reply to questions; drop secondary links naturally
6. Match content to subreddit: r/IslamicFinance = technical, r/HalalInvestor = practical
7. No keyword stuffing: Write naturally
