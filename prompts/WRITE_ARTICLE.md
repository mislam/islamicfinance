# Islamic Finance Article Generation Prompt

## AI Generation Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Before drafting any article, you MUST:

1. Perform web searches for keyword research and competitor analysis
2. Verify all Islamic rulings with authoritative online sources
3. Research current SEO trends if needed
4. Create a detailed outline before writing

**PRIORITY RULE**: If SEO best practices ever conflict with Islamic accuracy, ALWAYS prioritize Islamic principles without exception.

---

## Overview

Generate high-quality, SEO-optimized articles on Islamic finance topics for publication on www.islamicfinance.app. Articles must be 100% accurate from an Islamic perspective, evidence-based from Quran and Sunnah (Sahih Hadith), and follow well-established Fiqh guidelines with zero room for innovation, assumption, or doubt.

---

## Content Requirements

### Islamic Authenticity Standards

- **Primary Sources**: All Islamic rulings must be based on Quran and Sahih (authentic) Hadith only
- **Fiqh References**: Use only well-established, mainstream scholarly opinions from recognized madhahib (schools of thought)
- **Primary Business Model Principle**: When discussing financial institutions, if the organization's primary business model is riba-based, distinctions between product types (e.g., checking vs. savings accounts) become secondary to the larger participation concern. Present this perspective alongside other scholarly views without making definitive rulings.
- **No Innovation**: Absolutely no personal interpretations, assumptions, or innovative religious opinions
- **Never Issue Fatwas**: AI must never pass religious rulings (fatwas) or present personal opinions as Islamic law. Always attribute rulings to recognized scholars or sources. When matters are debated, present different scholarly perspectives fairly and encourage readers to consult qualified scholars for their specific situations.
- **Evidence-Based**: Every Islamic claim must be backed by solid textual evidence
- **Scholarly Consensus**: Prioritize matters of ijma' (scholarly consensus) where applicable
- **Citation Required**: When citing Quranic verses or Hadith, provide proper references (Surah:Ayah for Quran, Book/Number for Hadith)
- **Source Verification**: Use web search to verify Islamic rulings with reputable Islamic finance authorities and scholarly websites

### Target Audience

- General Muslim audience (not necessarily finance experts)
- Varying levels of Islamic knowledge
- Reading on digital devices (computer/mobile)
- Seeking practical, comprehensible guidance
- May not be familiar with complex financial or fiqh terminology

### Writing Style Guidelines

- **Clarity**: Use simple, clear language; avoid jargon where possible
- **Tone**: Respectful, educational, and compassionate
- **Structure**: Well-organized with logical flow
- **Examples**: Include practical, relatable examples when appropriate
- **Avoid**: Complex analogies, doubtful matters, controversial opinions without clear evidence, issuing personal fatwas or definitive rulings on debated issues
- **Scholarly Differences**: When legitimate differences of opinion exist among recognized scholars, present them concisely (2-3 sentences maximum per view) without making the article excessively long. Acknowledge the debate, present the strongest positions briefly, then guide readers to consult qualified scholars for personal situations.
- **Accessibility**: Define technical terms when first introduced
- **Paragraphs**: Keep paragraphs concise (3-5 sentences) for online readability

### Handling Controversial or Sensitive Topics

When writing about topics where Muslims have real-world financial dependencies or where scholarly debate exists:

- **Exercise Extra Caution**: Be especially careful with fact-checking and evidence verification
- **Acknowledge Complexity**: Recognize that modern financial systems create situations not explicitly addressed in classical fiqh
- **Present, Don't Prescribe**: Share what scholars have said, don't tell readers what they must do
- **Emphasize Consultation**: Always encourage readers to consult qualified scholars for their specific circumstances
- **Balance Honesty with Compassion**: Address contradictions and difficult truths while remaining respectful and understanding of people's situations
- **Avoid Absolutism on Debated Matters**: If scholars differ on an issue, don't present one view as the only correct interpretation

### Organization and Company References Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Never directly or indirectly endorse, promote, or recommend specific financial institutions, banks, companies, or service providers. Maintain complete neutrality when mentioning organizations.

**Rules for Mentioning Organizations:**

1. **No Endorsements**: Never state that an organization is "Shariah-compliant," "halal," or "reputable" without verification. Use neutral language instead.
   - ❌ Avoid: "Reputable Islamic banks operate according to Shariah principles..."
   - ✅ Better: "Islamic banks claim to operate according to Shariah principles..."
   - ❌ Avoid: "Institutions like [Company Name] offer Shariah-compliant alternatives..."
   - ✅ Better: "Various institutions offer Islamic financing alternatives. Muslims should research and verify the Shariah compliance of any financial institution they consider."

2. **Neutral Language**: When mentioning organizations, use neutral, factual language without judgment.
   - ❌ Avoid: "Organizations like [Company Name] and other reputable charities..."
   - ✅ Better: "Various charitable organizations accept such donations."

3. **Encourage Due Diligence**: Always emphasize that readers should do their own research and verification.
   - ✅ Good: "Muslims should research individual institutions, review their Shariah compliance certifications, and consult knowledgeable scholars to make informed decisions."

4. **Generic References**: Prefer generic terms over specific company names.
   - ✅ Good: "Various institutions," "some organizations," "Islamic financial institutions," "charitable organizations"

5. **Exceptions for Scholarly Bodies**: You may mention scholarly organizations (e.g., Islamic Fiqh Academy, AAOIFI) when citing them as sources of rulings or standards, but not as service providers or endorsements.

6. **No Service Recommendations**: Never recommend specific companies, banks, or financial products. Focus on explaining concepts and principles, then encourage readers to research options themselves.

### Punctuation and Writing Authenticity Guidelines

**Em Dashes (—):**

- **NEVER use em dashes** in articles as they are a common AI writing pattern that readers associate with generated content
- Replace with alternatives:
  - Use a period to split into two sentences for clarity
  - Use commas for parenthetical statements
  - Use colons for explanations or lists
  - Use parentheses for brief side notes

**Examples:**

- ❌ AI-like: "Muslims living in modern economies—it is essential."
- ✅ Better: "Muslims living in modern economies must understand this. It is essential."
- ✅ Better: "For Muslims living in modern economies, it is essential."
- ✅ Better: "Understanding riba is essential for Muslims living in modern economies."

**Other AI Writing Patterns to Avoid:**

- Minimize use of these overused AI-favorite words: meticulous/meticulously, delve into, tapestry, landscape (metaphorical), robust, paramount, pivotal, underscore
- Avoid repetitive "lists of three" patterns (e.g., "happier, stronger, and healthier")
- Vary sentence length significantly (mix short 8-word sentences with longer 25+ word ones)
- Use occasional contractions for natural tone where appropriate (e.g., "don't" instead of "do not" in conversational sections)
- Write for humans first; prioritize natural, authentic voice over formulaic patterns

## SEO Requirements

### Article Length

- **Target**: 1,800-2,500 words (optimal for SEO and reader engagement)
- **Flexibility**: Adjust based on topic depth—ensure content is comprehensive without unnecessary filler. Depth and user intent satisfaction matter more than arbitrary length targets.
- **Guidelines**:
  - **Minimum**: 1,500 words for standard articles
  - **Standard**: 1,800-2,500 words for most topics
  - **Comprehensive Guides**: 2,500-3,000 words for deep dives
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to write 1,800 words of excellent, comprehensive content than 2,500 words with filler. Fully answer user intent rather than padding word count.

### Meta Title

- **Length**: 50-60 characters (aim for 50-60 for optimal display)
- **Format**: Include primary keyword near the beginning
- **Style**: Compelling and click-worthy
- **Best Practice**: Front-load with most important keywords
- **Date Consideration**: Include current year for time-sensitive topics (e.g., "2026 Guide")
- **Example**: "Halal Investment Guide 2026: Islamic Finance"

### Meta Description

- **Length**: 135-155 characters (strict: aim for 140-150 characters)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Prioritize first 120 characters for mobile display to ensure key message visible on all devices
- **Content**: Concise summary with primary keyword
- **Call-to-Action**: Include subtle CTA when appropriate
- **Uniqueness**: Must be unique for each article

### Keywords Strategy (2026 SEO Best Practices)

**Modern Approach**: Focus on comprehensive topic coverage and user intent satisfaction rather than keyword density. Google's algorithms understand semantic meaning and context, not keyword counts.

#### Primary Keyword

- 1 main focus keyword (e.g., "Islamic mortgage," "halal investment")
- **Natural placement**: Include in title, H1, meta description, and naturally in first paragraph when contextually appropriate
- **No density targets**: Avoid keyword stuffing; focus on comprehensive topic coverage instead
- **Research Required**: Use web search to identify high-volume, low-competition keywords that match user intent

#### Secondary Keywords

- **3-5 related keywords** that are semantically related to the primary keyword
- **Definition**: Related terms, synonyms, or variations of the primary topic (e.g., if primary is "riba in Islam," secondary could be "interest in Islam," "riba types," "halal finance")
- **Usage**: Use naturally throughout content as semantic variations and related terms
- **Placement**: Include in subheadings where relevant, use as synonyms naturally in paragraphs
- **Balance**: Aim to include the exact keyword phrase at least once naturally (especially in subheadings), but also use natural variations and synonyms throughout. Google understands semantic meaning, so both exact phrases and variations help. The goal is natural, comprehensive coverage, not forced repetition.
- **Goal**: Cover the topic comprehensively from multiple angles using related terminology

#### Long-Tail Keywords & User Queries

- **2-4 specific phrases** that match actual user search queries
- **Definition**: Question-based or specific query phrases (e.g., "how to invest money according to Islam," "what is riba in banking," "halal alternatives to stock market")
- **Usage**: Address these naturally in Q&A sections, explanatory paragraphs, or dedicated sections
- **Best Practice**: For FAQ sections, include the exact query phrase (or close variant) in the question itself, as users often search for these exact phrases. In body paragraphs, natural variations are fine. The key is fully answering the user's intent while making the content discoverable for those searching the exact phrase.
- **Focus**: Answer the question fully rather than just including the phrase
- **Example**: If long-tail is "how to avoid riba in banking," create a section that fully answers this question (ideally with a heading like "How to Avoid Riba in Banking" or FAQ format with the exact question)

### Meta Keywords Array

- **Format**: `["primaryKeyword", "secondary1", "secondary2", "longTail1", "longTail2", ...]`
- **First keyword MUST be the primary keyword** (the one that appears in title/H1)
- **Total**: 5-8 keywords (1 primary + 3-5 secondary + 2-4 long-tail)
- **Purpose**: For internal tracking/analytics only (not rendered in HTML meta tags)
- **Note**: These keywords are stored in the database for tracking which keywords were targeted during content creation. They help with future content audits and keyword performance analysis, but are NOT used in HTML meta tags (which have no SEO value since 2009).

### Tags Array

- 4-6 descriptive tags
- Relevant to article topic and broader site categories
- Format: ["Islamic Finance", "Halal Investment", "Shariah Compliance"]

### Category

- Single primary category from site taxonomy
- Examples: "Islamic Banking", "Halal Investment", "Islamic Economics", "Zakat & Charity", "Sukuk & Islamic Bonds"

### Featured Snippets & AI Overviews Optimization

- **2026 Context**: Many finance queries trigger AI-generated summaries (Google AI Overviews), featured snippets, or voice search results. Content must be optimized for "Position Zero" and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO).
- **Strategy**: Structure content to answer questions clearly and concisely for potential featured snippet capture
- **Implementation**:
  - **Question-Format Headings**: Use question phrases as H2/H3 headings (e.g., "What Is Riba in Islam?" instead of "Understanding Riba")
  - **Answer First**: Place concise, direct answers (40-60 words) immediately after question headings, then expand with details
  - **Format by Intent**:
    - Paragraphs for definitions and explanations
    - Numbered lists or steps for how-to queries
    - Tables for comparisons
  - Use clear question-answer formats in FAQ sections
  - Provide direct, complete answers in opening paragraphs
  - Maintain natural flow while being specific and authoritative
- **Structured Data (Schema Markup)**: Content should be structured to support JSON-LD schema markup (handled at implementation level, but content structure should enable):
  - `Article` schema with author, date published/modified
  - `FAQPage` schema for Q&A sections
  - `HowTo` schema for step-by-step guides
  - `Person` schema for author credentials (supports E-E-A-T)
- **Voice Search Optimization**: Use conversational, natural language. Voice queries are longer and more conversational—structure content to answer "how," "what," "why" questions naturally.
- **E-E-A-T Priority**: Prioritize Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness through strong Quranic/Hadith sourcing and clear Islamic scholarship citations—especially critical for finance/YMYL (Your Money Your Life) topics
- **Balance**: Optimize for SERP features without sacrificing article depth or readability

### Image Optimization

- **Include**: 2-4 image placeholders where visuals enhance understanding
- **Types**: Diagrams of financial processes, infographics, comparison charts
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive and contextually relevant (50-125 characters), naturally including relevant terms when appropriate
- **Format**: `![Descriptive Alt Text with Keyword](image-url-placeholder)`
- **Examples**:
  - `![Islamic mortgage process diagram showing halal home financing steps](image-placeholder-1)`
  - `![Comparison chart of riba-based vs Shariah-compliant investment](image-placeholder-2)`
- **Purpose**: Enhance SEO, accessibility, and user engagement
- **Relevance**: Only suggest images that add genuine value to content understanding
- **Publishing Note**: Replace 'image-placeholder-X' with actual image paths during publishing. Use royalty-free or original visuals only to avoid copyright issues.

### Internal and External Linking

#### Internal Links

- **Quantity**: Suggest 2-4 internal links to related articles on www.islamicfinance.app
- **Format**: `[Anchor Text](/article/related-slug)`
- **Placement**: Naturally within content where contextually relevant; avoid forced links
- **Anchor Text**: Use descriptive, contextually relevant phrases that help users understand the link destination
- **Best Practice**: Follow Google's guidance—links should provide genuine value to readers
- **Example**: `Learn more about [halal investment strategies](/article/halal-investment-strategies)`

#### External Links

- **Restriction**: ONLY to authoritative Islamic sources
- **Quantity**: 1-3 per article maximum
- **Acceptable Sources**:
  - Recognized Islamic finance institutions (AAOIFI, Islamic Fiqh Academy)
  - Reputable scholarly websites (IslamQA, Seekers Guidance for specific rulings)
  - Official Quran/Hadith databases
- **Format**: Include full URL and brief context
- **Avoid**: Commercial sites, non-authoritative blogs, controversial sources

---

## Article Structure

### Slug

- **Format**: lowercase, hyphen-separated
- **Stop Words**: Remove unnecessary stop words (is, in, the, what, a, an, of, to, for) to keep slugs short and focused. Keep stop words only when essential for clarity or when part of proper names/titles
- **Length**: 3-6 words maximum (aim for 3-5 for optimal SEO)
- **Include**: Primary keyword
- **Date Consideration**: Use current year (2026) for time-bound topics; omit for evergreen content
- **Evergreen Strategy**: For evergreen topics, avoid year-specific references in content body to reduce future update needs
- **Examples**:
  - Time-sensitive: `halal-investment-guide-2026`
  - Evergreen (before): `what-is-riba-in-islam` → (better): `riba-in-islam`
  - With stop word kept for clarity: `guide-to-sukuk` (keeping "to" aids readability)
- **Best Practice**: Short, descriptive, naturally including relevant terms; prioritize brevity without sacrificing clarity

### Headline (H1)

- **Single H1 tag** per article
- Include primary keyword
- **Length**: 50-70 characters (strict: aim for 55-65 characters)
- Compelling and clear
- Different from meta title (can be more descriptive)
- **Example**: "The Complete Guide to Islamic Mortgages: Halal Home Financing"

### Body Content (Markdown Format)

#### Opening Section

- **First Paragraph**: Hook readers immediately, naturally introduce the topic (primary keyword may appear if contextually appropriate, but don't force it)
- **Context**: Explain why this topic matters to Muslims
- **Preview**: Brief overview of what the article covers (2-3 sentences)
- **Engagement**: Pose a relevant question or present a relatable scenario

#### Main Content Structure

Use hierarchical headings:
